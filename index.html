                <p>Some of the hobbies I have are playing video games, origami, and playing sports, typically
                        soccer.
                        Playing videogames is one of my favorite things to do on my down time. When I'm done
                        with work
                        or want to relax I play video games.
                        My favorite game is smite, smite is a moba where a team of 5 goes against another team
                        of 5.

                <p class="p1">Another hobby I have is doing origami. Origami is the Japanese art of folding papaer into
                        decorative
                        shapes and figures.
                        Mostly I do this when I have free time and I'm not too invested in it. I can only make
                        some
                        novice crafts and don't know every folding technique.
                        One of my favorite crafts is making a frog that you can make junp.

                <p>Something else that I do is play sports and most of the time I play soccer. Ever since I was
                        a little
                        kid I remember being on a soccer team.
                        For the most part it was fun, but what got to me the most was having to meet more people
                        since I
                        was shy at the time.
                        Then by the time I was in middle school I was less shy and decided to play a new sport,
                        which
                        was flag football.
                        These sports were very fun and I hope I can play again soon.
